## Introduction
Bitset is an array of boolean values that are stored as either 0 or 1. Each Boolean value is stored in the same area optmized for storage space. Each Boolean value is stored in one bit so each Bitset value takes up less space than a normal bool or vector. Traditional bool values take up 16 bits this is the same as 16 bitset values that functionaly do the same work.
